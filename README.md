All members of the [EIC Github Organization](https://github.com/eic) have read/write access and are welcome to push your
code directly to the main branch, no pull requests required!  It is strongly encouraged, however, to follow the recommendations
listed below.

### Recommendations

 * When adding code, it is suggested to include either a README or provide sufficient comments in the code which details basic usage,
   inputs, outputs, and so on.
 * There are a few directories corresponding to the different types of tests (beams, benches, etc.).  In order to make it easy for
   others to find your code, it is suggested that you add your code to the relevant directory.
   - For code for specifc test beams/setups, it is suggested to create a sub-directory in the relevant category (e.g. `Beam` for test
     beams).
   - And for code relevant to all/many tests, it is suggested to create a sub-directory in the `Common` category.
 * And while no pull requests are required, we do ask that you follow standard etiquette for contributing to a shared repository (e.g.
   always pull before you push).
